## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need at a minimum Java Version 8 (although more recent versions of Java will also work) and a command line interface
such as Windows PowerShell to run this program

To develop this program and work on its features, you will require a compatible Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and Maven installed

### Installing

To install the program on your device, first you must clone down this repository from GitHub to your local IDE

```

Your IDE should be able to import directly from a GitHub link and automatically open the project. If not, clone the repository down
using a Command Line Interface and open it manually

```
To clone using a CLI, in your command line type:

git clone https://github.com/jackhulatt/IMS-Project.git

This will clone the project to your local system, you can then navigage to it in your IDE 
to open it manually
```

To create a local connection to the required database, an installation of MySQL 8 is necessary.
