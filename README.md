# Project Title

A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Inventory Management System program that runs in a Command Line Interface (CLI)
, using a MySQL 8 Database to store and update data for the customers, items, and orders.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need at a minimum Java Version 8 (although more recent versions of Java will also work) and a command line interface
such as Windows PowerShell to run this program

To develop this program and work on its features, you will require a compatible Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and Maven installed

### Installing

To install the program on your device, first you must clone down this repository from GitHub to your local IDE

```

```

Your IDE should be able to import directly from a GitHub link and automatically open the project. If not, clone the repository down
using a Command Line Interface and open it manually

```
To clone using a CLI, in your command line type:

git clone https://github.com/jackhulatt/IMS-Project.git

This will clone the project to your local system, you can then navigage to it in your IDE 
to open it manually
```

To create a local connection to the required database, an installation of MySQL 8 is necessary.

## Running the tests

Due to medical circumstances and a lack of time, I have been unable to implement any additional tests other than the default ones.
I chose to focus my limited time on ensuring the base functionality of the product was functional. All tests included with the base
project pass with no problems.

### Unit Tests 

Functioning tests cover the Customer class, to ensure the functionality of the customer class to create a customer with pre-defined values.

Navigate to the tests folder, and right-click on the Customer tests and click run to run the tests. If all tests are successful, it 
will highlght in green.

## Deployment

To deploy this program, you must run it through a Command Line Interface (CLI) with MySQL Workbench 8 open on your system.
You will then be able to navigate the program in your CLI.
